You can filter by games and country.

Example of the format

Starting seed - http://steamcommunity.com/id/SunNoise/

Country Code - mx

AppID - 220

You can leave Country Code empty to search for all nationalities and you can also leave AppID blank.

The starting seed needs to be a public profile with friends or else you won't get anywhere. Try and find someone from the country or with the game your searching for with the steam search feature to get the seed.

This program uses FizzlerEx which uses Fizzler and the HtmlAgilityPack.
